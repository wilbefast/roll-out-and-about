Theme: 
-------------------
A movie adaptation of Transformers 4 made for 1982 hardware.
I chose the ZX Spectrum.

Controls: 
-------------------
* Arrow keys
* Space bar

Contraints: 
-------------------
The extended constraints from [Speccy Jam](http://www.speccyjam.com/rules/), including attributes.

I did not respect the framerate limitations.

* Max 4 audio channels of which only 1 can be used for samples (noise)
* Each 8x8 block of pixels can contain at most 1 of 8 colours
* A block's colours can be either light or dark (80% brightness)
* ZX Spectrum resolution: 256x192  
* Border (384x288) can display a single "dark" colour
